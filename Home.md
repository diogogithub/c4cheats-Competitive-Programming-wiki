Welcome to the wiki page of our competitive programming site.   This is designed as a class project for students to learn Github, and use it in a constructive way.    

This wiki has a few purposes.   First to be able to catalog problems for quick retrieval of practice problems, and the second is to create a learning tool for future generations to come.   There are a few standards I would like to mention before editing our wiki or code.

# Formatting Standards

#### Wiki

When creating or editing a programming topic, you will need to follow a template.  You may expand on the template, but to make sure everything is readable, please keep with this standard.

The first section is an introduction to the topic.   This should include when we would use it and a general idea of what it does.   For example, if I was teaching variables I would say, "Variables are a way to store information in the computer.  We would use them whenever we would want to store information to be retrieved later."

The second part dives into how it works.  You may want to give an example and solve the example using the code given.  Make sure you explain and give sample code.   Code on the wiki should be Java, or Python 3.5.  

The last thing is please create a table that looks like this:

| Name | Solution |
| ---- | ---- | 
| [Sample 1](#) | [Solution](#) |
| [Sample 2](#) | [Solution](#) |

#### Wiki Contests

Contests are listed by date order.   You must include the date, name of the contest with a link the problems, solutions (a link to the code on GitHub), and the type of problems that we have solved.   If we have not solved the problem, we do not list the algorithm we used to solve the problem.
