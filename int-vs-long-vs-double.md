**int**

The `int` is the most basic data type in java and probably the one everyone is familiar with. The `int` is short for `Integer` (a class which can wrap the primitive `int`). The `int` data type has a range from -2147483648 to 2147483647. `int`s are all whole real numbers. You cannot have a decimal if you have an `int`. If you were to divide two numbers that are not evenly divisible say 10 and 3, the result you would get would be 3.

**long**

The `long` (wrapper class `Long`) is, in basic terms very similar to the `int`. Both only contain whole real numbers. If you were to divide 10l / 3l the result would be 3l. Unlike an `int` though the `long` can store much larger numbers. The maximum value of a `long` is 9223372036854775807 and the minimum value is -9223372036854775808.
