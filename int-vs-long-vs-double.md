**int**

The `int` is the most basic data type in java and probably the one everyone is familiar with. The `int` is short for `Integer` (a class which can wrap the primitive `int`). The `int` data type has a range from -2147483648 to 2147483647. `int`s are all whole real numbers. You cannot have a decimal if you have an `int`. If you were to divide two numbers that are not evenly divisible say 10 and 3, the result you would get would be 3.

**long**

The `long` (wrapper class `Long`) is, in basic terms very similar to the `int`. Both only contain whole real numbers. If you were to divide 10l / 3l the result would be 3l. Unlike an `int` though the `long` can store much larger numbers. The maximum value of a `long` is 9223372036854775807 and the minimum value is -9223372036854775808. 

**double**

The `double` (wrapper class `Double`) is where the 3 start to diverge a little. The `double` unlike both an `int` and a `long` can store decimals. If you were to divide 10.0 / 3.0 the result would be 3.333333333333333. Both the `double` and `long` are 64 bit numbers. The `double` has a minimum value of 4.9E-324 and a maximum value of 1.7976931348623157E308.
